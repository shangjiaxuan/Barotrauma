1. path attribute registering (folder="Default")
	static reflect an interface that returns a IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<string, Action<XAttribute, ContentPath, ContentPath>>?>, static Immutable dictionary at ContentPath for XPath match (key), and Action(updates xattribute according to src dst path should replace default with actual folder path)
2. identifier attribute mapping (character uses speciesname for identifier)
3. override+inherit without variants (perhaps allow human character to override this on itsown?)
	Move CreateVariantXML and inherithistory out of IImplementVariants
4. fix? preprocess path update->preprocess xpath substitute->postprocess path update->postprocess xpath substitute inconsistency.
	specify preprocess to be "literal", relative path referering to parent's location?
5. package name to package instance resolution should be consistent (workshopid->name->alias)
	initial loading still cannot ensure package created, but later name evaluation should be consistent everywhere.
